  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm an IT systems engineer who loves road trips, aviation, hikes and swimming.  I'm interested in enhancing my IT skills and moving into development and have decided the best way to do this is by starting with the Thinkful Front-End Web Develpment class.  I hope to building new web sites and working with JavaScript as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>Constantly learning new skills and keeping a curious outlook about the world is very important to me.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
  <p>I'm from Austin, Texas and have recently returned after living in the Pacific Northwest for the last couple of years. Central Texas is a wonderful, scenic paradise that would be close to perfection if it weren't for the extended drought that plagues the area.</p>

  <h1>More about me</h1>
  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p>My favorite hobbies are aviation, hiking, swimming with my dog, Mia, traveling by road and air to exploring new places and new people.</p>
  <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
  <p>My dream job is to own my own business in the future (near) and to live in a remote coastal village location with electricity and a satellite internet connection but with little else outside of the local community.  A plus would be a small landing strip within a few miles that could handle small airplanes such as a Cessna 172, but not much larger than that.</p>
  <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
  <p>I listen to indie rock, Texas country, Rock Steady, classic rock.  I'm not going to SXSW.</p>
